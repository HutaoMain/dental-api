The Cheerful Sands color scheme you provided consists of two colors: turquoise (#29B3FF) and mimosa (#FBC00E). These colors can be used in various ways to create an attractive and cohesive design for your dental management system website.

For the background color, you could use a light or white color to provide contrast and make the other colors stand out. For the navbar, you could use one of the Cheerful Sands colors or a complementary color. For example, you could use turquoise (#29B3FF) as the main color for the navbar and mimosa (#FBC00E) as an accent color for buttons or links.

For the text color, you could use a dark color such as black or dark grey to ensure good readability against the light background. You could also use one of the Cheerful Sands colors for headings or other important text to create visual interest.

Ultimately, the choice of colors will depend on your personal preferences and the overall design of your website. I recommend experimenting with different combinations to find a color scheme that works best for you. ðŸ˜Š
